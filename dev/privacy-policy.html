                  <p>When you visit our site, we may collect the following types of information about you:</p>
                  <p><strong>Personal Information You Provide: </strong> When you use our Site, we may collect the following
                    types of personal information you provide us through forms and questionnaires on our Site.
                    This information can include your name, address, date of birth, telephone number, housing information,
                    income, work history, driver's license, passport or government issued ID and social security number.</p>

                  <p>If you choose to use the "Instant Bank Verification" service, you will be asked to provide,
                    in addition to the above, the log-in credentials to your bank accounts accounts. </p>

                  <p><strong>Third Party Sources: </strong> We may receive information about you from public and
                    commercially available sources, as permitted by law, and may combine this information with other
                    information we receive about you. For
                    example, if you log in through or use social media functionality embedded in the Site, we may receive
                    information
                    about you from those social media services. </p>

                  <p><strong>Analytics information:</strong> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party
                    analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Site. These tools collect
                    information sent by your browser or device, including the pages you visit and other information that
                    assists us in improving the Site. We aggregate this information so that it cannot be manipulated to
                    identify any particular user.</p>

                  <p><strong>Cookies information:</strong> Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by
                    the websites you visit. These text files can be read by websites to help to identify you when you
                    return. When you visit our Site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely
                    identifies your browser to enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie may also convey
                    information to us about how you use the Site (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other
                    actions you take on the Site), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Site
                    over time. There are two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie
                    remains on your computer after you have signed offline. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser
                    on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s
                    directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset
                    your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
                    features of the Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. To find out
                    how to see what cookies have been set and how to reject and delete the cookies, please visit:
                    <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="blank">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

                  <p><strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</strong> When you use the Site, we may employ clear gifs
                    (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users.
                    In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are
                    opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and
                    improvement of the Site. We may also use this information to provide you with more personalized
                    advertising experiences. You may choose to opt-out of some of this tracking through the links provided
                    in the "Your Choices" section of this Policy.</p>

                  <p><strong>Log file information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser
                    or device each time you access our Site. When you use our Site, our servers automatically record certain
                    log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request,
                    Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and
                    how you interact with links on the Site, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
                    information.</p>

                  <p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong> When you access the Site by or through a mobile device (including
                    but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one
                    or more "device identifiers," such as a universally unique identifier ("UUID"). Device identifiers are
                    small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which
                    uniquely identify your device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device
                    hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent
                    to the device by Pave. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the
                    Site. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device to enhance your navigation through the
                    Site. Some features of the Site may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers
                    is impaired or disabled.</p>

                  <p><strong>Commercial and marketing communications:</strong> We use the information we collect or receive
                    to communicate directly with you. We may send you e-mails containing newsletters, promotions and special
                    offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out of
                    such communications as set forth in the "Your Choices" section below. We also use your information to
                    send you service-related emails (e.g., purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates
                    to features of the service, and technical and security notices). You may not opt out of service-related
                    e-mails.</p>

                  <p>All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business.
                    We may share your personal information as follows:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If you apply for a loan, with the creditor, currently Cross River Bank, who originates all the loans
                      on the Site and any investor who purchases 100% of your loan.
                    </li>
                    <li>With service providers who help with parts of our business operations such as authenticating the
                      identity of potential borrowers, fraud prevention, verification of the information contained in your
                      account, bill collection, marketing and technology services, and financial institutions that we
                      partner with to offer a product and/or support our servicing activities or to improve such third
                      parties' services. Our contracts dictate that these third parties only use your information in
                      connection with the services they perform for us.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you elect to use the Instant Bank Verification service we use to authenticate the identity of
                      potential borrowers, we may share your bank account information and log-in credentials with the third
                      party which provides this service for us.
                    </li>
                    <li>With credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.</li>
                    <li>With law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when (1) we are compelled to do
                      so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, (2) we need to do so to comply with law, or
                      (3) if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of your personal information is necessary to
                      prevent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity. (4) to enforce our
                      Terms of Use or to protect the security or integrity of our Site and services; and/or (5) to exercise
                      or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Pave, our Users or others.

                  <p>Pave will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their own marketing
                    purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described above. However, we
                    may share information that has been made anonymous through de-identification or aggregation
                    ("De-Identified Data") and we do not limit our third party providers from using, selling, licensing,
                    distributing or disclosing De-Identified Data.</p>
                  <p>If you are a Pave customer, Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal
                    information in certain instances such as sharing your information so that third parties can market to
                    you.</p>
                  <p><strong>Change of Control:</strong> We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any
                    shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your
                    information such as customer names and email addresses and other user information related to the Site
                    may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell,
                    assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers,
                    acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or
                    proceedings involving all or a portion of the company. This includes a transfer to any back-up service
