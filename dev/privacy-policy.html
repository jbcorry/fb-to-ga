                  <p>When you visit our site, we may collect the following types of information about you:</p>
                  <p>Personal Information You Provide: When you use our Site, we may collect the following types of personal information you provide us through forms and questionnaires on our site. This information can include your name, address, telephone numbers, birthdate, citizenship, housing information, income, work history, and social security number.</p>
                  <p><strong>Party Sources: </strong>We may receive information about you from public and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, and may combine this information with other information we receive about you. For example, if you log in through or use social media functionality embedded in the Site, we may receive information about you from those social media services.</p>
                  <p><strong>Analytics information:</strong> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the site. These tools collect information sent by your browser or device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the site. We aggregate this information so that it cannot be manipulated to identify any particular user.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cookies information:</strong> Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by the websites you visit. These text files can be read by websites to help to identify you when you return. When you visit our site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser to enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the site (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the site), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the site over time. There are two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you have signed offline. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. To find out how to see what cookies have been set and how to reject and delete the cookies, please visit: http://www.aboutcookies.org.</p>
                  <p><strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</strong> When you use the site, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the site. We may also use this information to provide you with more personalized advertising experiences. You may choose to opt-out of some of this tracking through the links provided in the "Your Choices" section of this Policy.</p>
                  <p><strong>Log file information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or device each time you access our site. When you use our site, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the site, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
                  <p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong> When you access the site by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers," such as a universally unique identifier ("UUID"). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Pave. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the site. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device to enhance your navigation through the site. Some features of the site may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
                  <p><strong>Commercial and marketing communications:</strong> We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you e-mails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out of such communications. We also use your information to send you service-related emails (e.g., purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the service, and technical and security notices). You may not opt out of service-related e-mails.</p>

                  <h5 class="legal-section-title">2. How we share your information</h5>

                  <p>All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business. We may share your personal information with:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If you apply for a loan, the creditor, currently Cross River Bank, who originates all the loans on the Site and any investor who purchase 100% of your loan.</li>

Our contracts dictate that these third parties only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
                    <li>Credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.</li>

(4) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (5) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Pave, our Users or others.</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Pave will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described above. However, we may share information that has been made anonymous, so that it does not identify a specific user, is not considered personal information.</p>
                  <p>If you are a Pave customer, Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances such as sharing your information so that third parties can market to you.</p>
