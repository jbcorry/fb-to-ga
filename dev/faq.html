                      <p>Pave's 2-3 year consumer loans range in size from $3,000 up to $25,000. Pave's unique approach to underwriting takes a holistic view of a person's situation and potential, not just their FICO score</p>

                      <p>We're able to offer low rates because we personalize our approach to underwriting and take a holistic view of each borrower's unique situation.</p>
                      <p>We start by reviewing the individual's credit score and history, then incorporate additional factors like use of funds, work history, current employment, education and future earning potential. This gives us plenty of opportunities to recognize how financially responsible a person can be, and it's how we can give the lowest possible rate.</p>
                      <p>The interest rates we offer range from 5.99 - 27.1% with an origination fee of 1 - 6%. </p>

                      <p>An <strong>interest rate</strong> is the cost of a loan, not including fees. It is reflected as a percentage that can be used to calculate your monthly payments. </p>
                      <p>For example, let’s say you borrow $20,000 at an interest rate of 6% with a 2 year term. This means you will pay back a total of $21,200 over 2 years, broken down into monthly payments of $883.33. </p>
                      <p>An <strong>APR</strong>, or annual percentage rate, represents the cost of credit as a yearly rate. It includes not only the interest rate but also Pave’s origination fee.</p>
                      <p>The APR we offer ranges from 5.99% - 27.1%.</p>

                      <p>At Pave we base the lending decision on a number of factors, including your employment, your income and your assets. When filling out your application, please ensure that the income and assets you list can be supported by documentation.</p>
                      <p>We hope the following provides clear guidelines on what we can accept as verification:</p>
                      <p><strong>Identity Verification</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>Proof of your identity (clear photo)</p></li>
                        <li><p>Proof of your citizenship (either a valid passport, or a combination of your driver's license + birth certificate)</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Employment/Income Verification</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>Your 2 most recent pay stubs showing: your name, the pay period, your salary, your employer’s name</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Asset Verification</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>Bank statements for the asset amount that you report on your application. This usually refers to bank accounts - checking, savings or investment accounts</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>(Unfortunately, we can’t accept mortgages, land titles or appraisals as proof of liquid assets)</p>
